<p>Here is a lesson that I learned the hard way.</p>
<p>Skolem’s paradox is the apparent mismatch between the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Within</em> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ZFC}\)</span>, we may show that nonenumerable sets exist, such as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. So, there must be uncountably many sets in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ZFC}\)</span>. Let’s call this the “internal view”, as it is a theorem within <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ZFC}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ZFC}\)</span> is a first order theory. Therefore, by the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem, it has a model <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}\)</span> with an enumerable domain, i.e. there are only countably many sets in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ZFC}\)</span>. Let’s call this the “external view” as it is a theorem about <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ZFC}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So the paradox is the seeming contradiction between the internal view and external view of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ZFC}\)</span>. At first glance, I took this to mean something was deeply wrong with first-order logic or <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ZFC}\)</span> or both. But upon further reading, it became clear that this paradox is a fake one, and I fell for it hook, line and sinker.</p>
<p>To discredit this faux paradox, I will point out and resolve the ambiguity of both the internal and external views.</p>
<p>Let’s start by tackling the internal view. <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ZFC}\)</span> is a formal theory, a collection of sentences composed of symbols. It is <strong>not</strong> a model. Hence, the phrase “there must be uncountably many sets in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ZFC}\)</span>” is, by itself, meaningless. To read a meaning out of the phrase, you must implicitly assume an interpretation/model of the symbols in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ZFC}\)</span>, a personal bias of what the symbols mean to <strong>you</strong>, which is that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ZFC}\)</span> is a theory of pure sets. Let’s call this implicit interpretation <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{S}\)</span>. In this interpretation, the internal view holds.</p>
<p>Now in the second point, we invoked the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem to explicitly put forward a different, maybe even esoteric interpretation <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}\)</span> with an enumerable domain. Calling the objects in this domain “sets”, the external view must hold of <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}\)</span>.</p>
<p>But as the internal and external views are statements about different models, they are therefore mutually independent. No paradox.</p>
<p>The real problem is this: we constructed <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ZFC}\)</span> to precisely capture just the notion of pure sets (which has to be nonenumerable) yet the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem means it also captures additional unwanted notions. We cannot change the first order theory we use as the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem applies just as well to any theory. So first order logic must be incapable of exactly capturing the notion of pure sets. But this is a different problem altogether for another day.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The lesson is that formal theories are just symbols - don’t read too much meaning into what the symbols mean.</p>
